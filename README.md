## :robot: ASMV Casing: Protective Innovation for Robotics and Drones
Versatile Protection: The ASMV Casing is meticulously designed to encase the ASMV Module, providing a perfect fit and robust protection. Despite its compactness, it ensures the module is safeguarded, pivotal for your projects.

### :snowflake: Key Features

- **Passive Cooling**: Engineered with thermal efficiency, the ASMV Casing supports passive cooling, averting the need for active cooling mechanisms and ensuring optimal operation temperatures in demanding scenarios.
  
- **Compact and Convenient**: Its diminutive stature renders the ASMV Casing an exemplary choice for space-constrained projects without compromising on protection or functionality.
  
- **3D Printable**: Embracing the customization ethos, the casing is 3D printable, allowing for swift prototyping and customization, thereby spurring innovation and adaptability.
  
- **Multiple Attachment Points**: The casing boasts various mounting points, facilitating secure installation on a myriad of platforms, be it drones, robots, or bespoke assemblies.

### :handshake: Accessibility and Ease of Use
The ASMV Casing is more than a protective enclosure; it's a statement of function. It grants unfettered access to all ASMV Module ports and connectors while maintaining a polished and professional appearance, as denoted by its distinctive logo.

## :warning: Warning: 3D Printing Materials
When 3D printing the ASMV Casing, ensure the material has a melting point higher than 80Â°C. Standard PLA is not recommended due to its lower fuse point. Select materials that can withstand higher temperatures to maintain the integrity of the casing.
